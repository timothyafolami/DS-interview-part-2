Objectives

    Task 4: OCR Functionality Implementation
    Objective: Develop the capability to extract text from images using OCR technology.
    Key Actions: Integrate and configure an OCR tool (e.g., Tesseract).

    Task 5: Web Scraping for Product Images
    Objective: Scrape product images from e-commerce websites for training data CNN_Model_Train_Data.csv.
    Key Actions: Automate scraping, download images, and store them systematically and make sure you have enough data to train the CNN model.
    
    Endpoint 2: OCR-Based Query Processing
    Functionality: Extract and process handwritten queries using the same logic as Endpoint 1.
    Input: Image file with handwritten text.
    Output: Same output format as Endpoint 1, adapted for image inputs.

Implementation Flow

    1. OCR
        1. Used Python EasyOCR library. 
        2. Created a function that takes in an image path and returns the text found in it.
    
    2. Web Scraping
        1. Read the referenced dataset
        2. Cleaned the stock code column
        3. Cross checked the rock code with the previous cleaned data
        4. Made some decisions on the product to scrape 
        5. Created a python function to scrap product image links from AMAZON.
        6. Stored the scraped image links in respective datasets. One dataset per product.
        7. created a save image function that automatically creates a folder and saved the product images
        8. Moved all the folders in an Image folder 

    3. Endpoint 2. 
        1. Created an html file for a user interface
        2. Created a route for an Endpoint
        3. Integrated the endpoint to the frontend
        4. The endpoint uses the function created earlier to get the texts in the image, then it sends back to 
        the query reviewer and output response functions created in module 1.

Challenges and Solution: 
    1. The products from the stock codes are five. Some has a general name while other don't. It's difficult to 
    retrieve significant products from ecommerce websites like amazon and ebay. So I created a list of products to work with.
    This list of products are used for the image link scraping process.
    2. EasyOCR performance is bad when it comes to hand writing recognition. A solution is to train a deep learning
    model that will be able to do this correctly. 
    3. The endpoint integration kept giving an error when image is uploaded. So i created a separate method to handle
    the image upload. I ensured that the enpoint is working effectively as expected.


Conclusion:

    Though the ocr performance is bad, but we do have a very good stsyem that handles image input of handwriting and returns
    the expected product and response.
